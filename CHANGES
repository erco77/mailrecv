1.14 - Jul 29, 2022
===================
   > Remove unused maxsecs (limit.connection_secs instead)
   > Limits conf file load sscanf()'s
   > Logs timeout errors, added Log locking for thread safety
   > Decreased default limit.connection_secs: 600s -> 300s

1.13 - Jul 15, 2022
===================

  > Modified remote ip address reporting so logfile's 'F' flag
    logs the remote ip address for ALL log lines. aids fail2ban filtering.

  > Made fail2ban filtering the default, and 'loghex' now defaults to 'on'.
    Sometimes probes include control characters that screws up fail2ban,
    causing fail2ban to fail to parse:

    WARNING Error decoding line from '/var/log/mailrecv.log' with 'utf-8'.
            Consider setting logencoding=utf-8 (or another appropriate encoding)
            for this jail. Continuing to process line ignoring invalid characters: [..ctrl chars..]

1.12 - Mar 30, 2020
===================

  > Created manpages for mailrecv and mailrecv.conf in POD format:
    mailrecv.conf.pod is still in progress; documenting the delivery
    and error commands will take some work.

  > Reimplemented 'ascii_smtp' as 'limit.smtp_ascii' in .conf file

1.10 - Mar 28, 2020
===================

  > Added fail2ban style errors for common probes

  > Added the special logfile flag 'F', which generates error messages
    that fail2ban can easily parse; a message that includes (in one line)
    the IP of the remote, a unique ERROR indicator, and a free form error
    message that fail2ban can ignore, but is useful for auditing, e.g.

      ERROR: [192.168.1.1] <free form errormsg>
      \____/  \_________/  \__________________/
        |          |               |
        |          |               |___ error message useful for auditing
        |          |
        |          |__ Remote's IP address in brackets that fail2ban needs for firewalling
        |
        |__ Fixed "ERROR:" string to key off of
