NO. HELL NO

> Check for mail loops.

  No; there's no way to check for mail loops, so don't even ask.
  We don't SEND email, we just receive it and forward it to either
  files or other programs (pipes). Pipes can do what they want, 
  we don't know what they'll do with the message. Those programs
  have to handle mail loops.

> Add a way to autorespond with a text file's contents.

  NO. Use a pipe instead, and let the command handle the details
  of outbound mail delivery..
