(DONE) > Put a limits on everything:
(DONE)     > Number of SMTP commands a remote can send, e.g. 25.
(DONE)     > Number of SMTP unknown command errors (in case someone just throws garbage at the port)
(DONE)     > Number of failed SMTP operations (e.g. if remote persists in continuing to send beyond RCPT TO max)
(DONE)     > Time limit in seconds
(WIP)      > DATA size limit (in bytes)

      # LIMIT                 VALUE      ERROR CODE + MESSAGE
      # --------------------- -----      ------------------------------------
      limit.smtp-commands     25         500 Too many SMTP commands received
      limit.smtp-unknowncmd   4          500 Too many bad commands
      limit.smtp-failcmds     4          500 Too many failed commands
      limit.connection        600        500 Connection timeout
      limit.data-size         24000000   552 Too much mail data.
      limit.rcpt_to           5          452 Too many recipients (RFC 2821 4.5.3.1)

> When allowing connections from the great unwashed, 
  we might want to:

      * Allow an email address to deliver ONLY from certain servers
      * Allow an email address to give a specific error FROM ALL SERVERS
      * Reject all else
  
  So to allow:
  	> fltk.coredev@fltk.org only from google, send to pipe
  	> fltk.general@fltk.org only from google, send to pipe
	> fltk-bugs@fltk.org from anyone, send an error
	> info@fltk.org from anyone, send an error
	> postmaster@fltk.org from anyone, send an error

  ..would be:

      # Define a group called '+news_gateway' and add regex's to it
      group +news_gateway add ^mail[0-9]*\.google\.com$
      group +news_gateway add \.google\.com$
      group +news_gateway add \.pair\.com$
      group +news_gateway add ^1\.2\.3\.4$		# a specific IP address

      # The above group will be compared to the remote server's hostname/ip
      #    If rcpt_to matches but server doesn't, error is:
      #        550 Your server 'host[1.2.3.4]' not permitted to send mail to 'fred@bar.com'
      #
      deliver rcpt_to fltk.coredev@fltk.org allow_server=+news_gateway pipe /usr/sbin/newsd -mailgateway fltk.coredev 2>&1 | /usr/bin/logger
      deliver rcpt_to fltk.general@fltk.org allow_server=+news_gateway pipe /usr/sbin/newsd -mailgateway fltk.coredev 2>&1 | /usr/bin/logger

      # The following errors will be sent for these addresses to any server
      error   rcpt_to info@fltk.org         allow=*  550 This address disabled. Join the google group fltk.general to contact the admins.
      error   rcpt_to postmaster@fltk.org   allow=*  550 This address disabled. Join the google group fltk.general to contact the admins.

      # All other rcpt_to addresses will generate an error
      #   550 No such recipient 'fred@bar.com'

> NO: This means config involves multiple files, too complicated and too many
  NO: chances for attack vectors + abuse.
  NO: 
  NO:   Allow a python script to be invoked for checking helo, mail from, rcpt to, and data
  NO:   So in mailrecv.conf:
  NO: 
  NO:   	checkscript helo      /path/to/foo.py -helo
  NO:   	checkscript mail_from /path/to/foo.py -mail_from
  NO:   	checkscript rcpt_to   /path/to/foo.py -rcpt_to
  NO:   	checkscript data      /path/to/foo.py -data
  NO: 
  NO:   Pass info about the remote as env variables:
  NO: 
  NO:         MAILRECV_REMOTEHOSTINFO=foo@bar.com[1.2.3.4] <-- who we know they are via IP and reverse lookup
  NO: 	MAILRECV_HELO=foo@bar.com		     <-- who they said they are
  NO: 	MAILRECV_ERRFILE=/tmp/.mailrecv-err.<pid>    <-- where python script can put error messages
  NO: 
  NO:   In all cases, data passed to the script is on stdin
  NO:   All error output from python script should probably be piped to logger(1)
